# High-Resolution_Hazard_Mapping_for_Lander_Navigation_Using_Super-Resolution_Techniques
This project generates high-resolution hazard maps (1m grid) for safe lander navigation on the Moon/Mars. Using super-resolution techniques, 5m orbital data is enhanced to 1m resolution, enabling detection of craters, boulders, and rough terrain for safe landing site selection and autonomous navigation.
